We analyse data from Google's Search Console for multiple domains.

The data is provided in a way that Google gives in folder

Folder name is domain property.

Inside each folder you have multiple csv files:
- Countries.csv (columns Country,Clicks,Impressions,CTR,Position)
- Dates.csv (columns Date,Clicks,Impressions,CTR,Position)
- Devices.csv (columns Device,Clicks,Impressions,CTR,Position)
- Filters.csv (columns Filter,Value)
- Pages.csv (columns Top pages,Clicks,Impressions,CTR,Position)
- Search appearance.csv (Search Appearance,Clicks,Impressions,CTR,Position)
- Queries.csv (Top queries,Clicks,Impressions,CTR,Position)


So example location of file is

`data/denis-dohr-glas-gebaeudereinigung.de-Performance-on-Search-2025-03-02/Countries.csv`
